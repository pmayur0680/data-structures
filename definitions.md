## Linked List

Linked List is a linear data structure consists of nodes where each node contains data field (value) and a reference (link/pointer) to the next node in the list. Head, tail, and length are properties of linked list.

### Array v Linked List

- Array store elements in contiguous memory locations and allows faster access to an element at a specific index. In Linked List, elements are usually not stored in contiguous locations.
- Array size cannot be altered at runtime. However, in a linked list allows for a dynamic size that can change at runtime.
- Any element in an array can be directly accessed with its index; however in the case of a linked list, all the previous elements must be traversed to reach any element.
- In array insertion and deletion operation takes more time but in linked last these operations are fast.

## Singly/Doubly Linked List

In Singly Linked List, each node contains data field (value) and a reference (link/pointer) to the next node in the list.

In Doubly Linked List, each node contains data field (value) and a reference (link/pointer) to the next and previous node in the list.
